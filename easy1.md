So basically its a one time pad, can be directly solved using online decoders, to solve manually, take letter from the key one by one, find it on the row or column doesn't matter the output will be the same, now traverse that
row till u see the first letter of the cipher text and see the corresponding mapped letter in the columns to get the decrypted text.
